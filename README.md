## Arsh Khan

Simple Web App that can pull a number of patient records off of HAPI FHIR.

How to use:
+ Pull the repository or download the zip of the files
+ Go to the inner folder (seamlessmd-assignment) and run `npm i`. This will install all the required modules.
+ After that is done run `npm run start` to start the server
+ Once the server is initialized it will open the webpage which will allow you to enter the number of patient entries you want to get

Features:
+ You can view the information in a table rather than having to view the raw JSON
+ You can get aggregate information on the Age and Gender spread across all patients
